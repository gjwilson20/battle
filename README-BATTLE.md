## Battleships
Battleships (also known as Battleship) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on a grid on which a player's ship(s) are concealed from their opponent. The aim of the game is to correctly guess the co-ordinates for the opponent's hidden ship(s) with a correct guess resulting in a hit and sinking your opponent's ship. This game is player vs computer

## User story 
1) As a user I wanted to be able to create a randomly generated grid for the computer to place their ship - I will know I have done this when there is a ship to find on the grid.

2) As a user I wanted to be able to choose co-ordinates as guesses for my turns - I will know I have done this when there are options to input my column and row choices.

3) As a user I wanted to be able to keep track of my turns and know how many I have used - I will know I have done this when my boards update and show what turn I am on.

4) As a user I wanted to be able to visually see where my guesses are on the computer's board - I will know I have done this when I see my previous guesses marked with an M for miss.

5) As a user I wanted to know if my guesses were repeated, not on the grid, not using integers - I will know I have done this when I see error messages shown and instructions on what to do next.

6) As a user I wanted to know whether I had hit my opponent's ship - I will know I have done this when the computer's grid shows with an X and a successful message to let me know I've guessed correctly.

7) As a user I wanted to know where the computer's randomly generated ship was hidden if I didn't manage to find it within all my allocated guesses - I will know I have done this when the computer displays a message stating I have run out of turns and I displays an updated board with an S to demonstrate where the ship was hidden
